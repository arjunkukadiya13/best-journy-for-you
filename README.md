## Best Journey For You

### Description

This project utilizes graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm to help customers find the shortest travel paths. It offers flexibility for both direct flights and multi-stop journeys.

### Key Features

**Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most efficient travel route. <br>

### Journey Planning Options:

- **Direct Flights:** Enter two cities to find available direct routes.
- **Multi-Stop Journeys:** Input source, destination, and stop points to get the optimal path.
- **Flight Availability Check:** Displays possible routes based on flight availability.
- **Ticket Booking:** Book tickets directly after viewing the route.

### How It Works

1. **Graph Theory & Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Cities are nodes, flights are edges. The algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes.
2. **Direct Flight Planning**: Input two city names to find direct flights.
3. **Multi-Stop Journey Planning**: Input source, destination, and stops to calculate the best path.
4. **Ticket Booking**: Book tickets through the application after the path is displayed.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Input Journey Details**: Choose direct flight or multi-stop journey and enter city names.
2. **View Routes**: The shortest path is displayed based on inputs.
3. **Book Tickets**: Proceed to book tickets if satisfied with the route.
